## Project 1: Predict Customer Churn
The first project of [ML DevOps Engineer Nanodegree](https://www.udacity.com/course/machine-learning-dev-ops-engineer-nanodegree--nd0821) by Udacity. This project aims to identify credit card customers that are most likely to churn. The project includes a Python package for a machine learning project that follows coding (PEP8) and engineering best practices for implementing software (modular, documented, and tested). The package can be run interactively or from the command-line interface (CLI).

# Predict Customer Churn

Project **Predict Customer Churn** of ML DevOps Engineer Nanodegree Udacity

## Project Description
This is a project to implement best coding practices. This project aims to identify credit card customers that are most likely to churn. The project includes a Python package for a machine learning project that follows coding (PEP8) and engineering best practices for implementing software (modular, documented, and tested). The package has the flexibility of being run interactively or from the command-line interface (CLI).
